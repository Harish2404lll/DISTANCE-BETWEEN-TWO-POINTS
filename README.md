# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get the two values from the user.
### Step 2: 
Assign the value of second variable to a temporary variable.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Assign the value in temporary variable to the first variable.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:
```
import math
l1=[10,6]
l2=[4,2]
d=math.sqrt(math.pow(l2[0]-l1[0],2)+math.pow(l1[1]-l2[1],2))
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```
### OUTPUT:

![python distance between two points](https://github.com/Harish2404lll/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/141472096/04e9350a-500a-41d6-b396-363c2d240b5f)

### RESULT:
Thus the distance between two points is successfully solved by using a python program
